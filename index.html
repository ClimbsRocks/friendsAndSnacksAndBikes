    <h3>A quick intro to who we are and what we do</h3>

      Here's some info about the rides:
      </p>
      <p>
      We meet each Thursday at 7AM for coffee & snacks at various coffee houses around the city, then go off and do a ride that gets most people back and into work between 9 and 10. We generally send out the coffee place the Wednesday before the ride, but you can plan on it being at 7AM every Thursday. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Every other week we do the Marin Headlands (Hawk Hill- a pretty substantial hill if you're just getting into biking for longer than 2 miles at a time, or a really fun one if clip-ins are your thing). Then on the other weeks, we do a more relaxed city ride up Twin Peaks or some other small hill in the city. 
      </p>

      <p>
      All rides are no-drop to the top (there's always going to be someone to ride with you- no person left behind!), but once at the top, some people have to splinter off rapidly to go to work, while others might extend the ride a bit longer, or head home at a relaxed pace.
      </p>

      <p>
      This is definitely a social ride, not a competitive ride, but if you're the competitive type, there are normally a handful of people around who prefer their coffee with a substantial helping of sweat :)
      </p>

      <p>
      Overall, it's a fun and joking group, and one of the best ways to wake up that I've found yet!
      </p>

      <p>
      Hope to have you join us one of these weeks!
